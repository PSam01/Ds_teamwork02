# Distributed Systems Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the second group assignment in the Distributed Systems course at the University of the Aegean. The assignment involved developing a distributed system using Java Sockets and RMI.

## Project Description

The project aims to create a simplified electronic store for IT products, following a client-server-server model. The system comprises two servers:
- User Management Server: Handles user authentication and client interactions.
- Inventory Management Server: Manages the inventory of products.

Clients can search for products, view details, and make purchases, while administrators can add or remove products. The project demonstrates the use of Java RMI for user-server communication and sockets for server-server communication, ensuring real-time updates and consistency in the product inventory.

## Technologies Used

- Java RMI
- Java Sockets
- No database required, in-memory data structures used

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Product search and purchase functionalities
- Administrator capabilities to manage product inventory
- Concurrent client handling with race condition management
